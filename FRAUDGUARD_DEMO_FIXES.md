# FraudGuard Demo App - Issues Fixed

## Problems Identified and Solutions

### 1. Zero Scores Issue
**Problem**: All agents were showing 0.0 scores because they were stuck in warmup mode with high thresholds.

**Root Cause**: 
- TouchAgent required 50 gestures (reduced to 10, then 5)
- TypingAgent required 10 keystrokes (reduced to 5)
- UsageAgent required 5 sessions (reduced to 2)

**Solution**: 
- Reduced warmup thresholds in all agent classes
- Improved score display formatting to show "--" instead of "0.0" when no data
- Added better warmup detection logic

### 2. Warmup Not Completing Properly
**Problem**: Users couldn't see progress or complete warmup even after providing sufficient data.

**Solution**:
- Added progress indicators showing current data count vs required threshold
- Added "Submit Typing Data" button to manually complete typing warmup
- Added toast notifications when warmup completes
- Improved warmup status display in chips

### 3. Dashboard Redirecting Outside App
**Problem**: Dashboard activity was potentially crashing or redirecting to external apps.

**Solution**:
- Added error handling in DashboardActivity to prevent crashes
- Ensured all activities stay within the app
- Added proper intent handling

### 4. Demo Stopping When Leaving App
**Problem**: UI updates stopped when app went to background, causing scores to reset.

**Solution**:
- Modified onPause() to not stop the demo when app goes to background
- Added onResume() to restore UI updates when returning to app
- Improved state persistence
