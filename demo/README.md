# Streamlit demo (demo/)

Optional dashboard-related code. This folder currently contains helper placeholders (`charts.py`, `user_agent.py`). A Streamlit app script (e.g., `app.py`) is not included in this snapshot.

If you add a Streamlit app here, install the local requirements and run it with:

```bat
python -m venv ..\.venv
..\.venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt
..\.venv\Scripts\python -m streamlit run demo\your_app.py
```

Dependencies for this folder are in `demo/requirements.txt`.
